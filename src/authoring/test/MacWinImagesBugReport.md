## Description

The current implementation of our code has a bug when it comes to loading images on Mac or Windows. The current version uses slashes in the way that only works for Windows.

## Expected Behavior

Images load on both Mac or Windows.

## Current Behavior

Images only consistently load on Windows.

## Steps to Reproduce

 1. Open Authoring and load any image on Windows. Save the game and load in Player, or just mess with it in Authoring. It works.
 2. Do the same on Mac. The image doesn't consistently load.

## Failure Logs

Often, NullPointerExceptions are generated by incorrectly-formatted file paths for images.

## Fix for Bug

Using a conditional statement to check the operating system type and formatting paths appropriately could help with the issue.
