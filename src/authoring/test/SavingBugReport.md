## Description

The current implementation of our code has a bug when it comes to saving image URLs. Although the frontend is able to display the images correctly, the backend has not been able to save and reuse these images later.

## Expected Behavior

The filename for images stored in the XML file output generated by the backend should be of the form: "C:\username\filepath".

## Current Behavior

The filename for images stored in the XML file output generated by the backend is of the form: "file:/C:/username/filepath". This is an invalid image URL from the perspective of the backend and prevents proper saving.

## Steps to Reproduce

 1. Add a background image to the map.
 2. Create a simple agent with an image associated with it.
 3. Add one instance of the agent to the map.
 4. Attempt to save the game.

## Failure Logs

There are no stack traces that display. The error is only evident upon looking in the resources folder and finding no agent images are present, or by looking at the XML file and seeing the filepath is in the wrong format.

## Fix for Bug

This bug has to do with communication between the front and backend regarding the image URLs. In order to test if the code is/is not working, my test will read the XML file output from saving a game and try to find the character sequence: "file:". If this is present, the backend's version of the URL is incorrect.
